# Music Recommendation System
 
Music recommender systems can suggest songs to users based on their listening patterns. The objective of this project is to build a music recommendation system that can provide personalized song recommendations to users based on their music listening habits.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle and is part of the KKBOX Music Recommendation Challenge. It contains data from KKBOX, Asiaâ€™s leading music streaming service, and includes information on user listening habits, user demographics, and song details.

## Approach
The music recommendation system is built using collaborative filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering is a technique used to make personalized recommendations by analyzing user behavior and preferences. In this project, we use the user's past listening history to recommend new songs that they might like.

The approach involves building a matrix factorization model using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The SVD algorithm is used to decompose the user-item interaction matrix into two matrices, one representing users and the other representing items. The model then predicts the user's preferences for items that they have not yet interacted with.

## Results
The music recommendation system built using the collaborative filtering technique was able to provide personalized song recommendations to users based on their past listening history. The SVD algorithm was able to predict the user's preferences for songs that they have not yet interacted with, thereby improving the user's overall music listening experience.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the music recommendation system built using collaborative filtering techniques was able to provide personalized song recommendations to users based on their past listening history. The SVD algorithm was used to build the matrix factorization model, which was able to predict user preferences for songs that they have not yet interacted with. The system has the potential to improve user engagement and satisfaction with the music streaming service.
